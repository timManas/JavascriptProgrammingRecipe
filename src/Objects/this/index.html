    <h1>"this"</h1>
    - Used to access the object itself

    Ex:
    let user = {
        name: "Tim",
        age: 33,

        sayHi() {
            alert(this.name)      // Will call out Tim
        }
    };

    user.sayHi()    // Tim
    // Also notice we placed a function inside an object 

    Note:
    - 'this' can be used in any funciton, even if its not a method of an object
    Ex:
    function sayHi() {alert(this.name)}        // This is legal

    In this case, the value of 'this' is evaluated at RunTime
    Ex:
    let user = {name: "John"}
    let admin = {name: "Admin"}

    function sayHi() {
        alert(this.name)
    }

    // Use the same funciton in two objects
    user.f = sayHi
    admin.f = sayHi

    user.f()    // Returns Tim
    admin.f()   // Returns admin
    admin['f']  // Returns admin

    Warning: Calling 'this' without an object will return "Undefined"
    Ex: function sayHi() {alert(this)}
    sayHi()     // Returns Undefined

    <h2>Arrow Functions have no "this"</h2>
    - Arrow functions are special and have no "this"

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    - Functions that are stored in Object properties are called "methods"
    - Methods can reference an object as "this"
    - Value of 'this' is evaluated at run time
    - A function can be copied between objects
    - Arrow functions have no "this". When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from the outside
