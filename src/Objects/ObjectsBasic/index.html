    <h1>Objects</h1>
    
    What ? 
    - Used to store collections of data 
    - <b>objects have key/value pairs where the key is a STRING and values can be anything</b>

    How to create an Object in JS ?
    Ex:
    let user = Object();
    let user = {};      // this is called an Object literal

    let user = {
        name:"John",        // These are properties
        age:"33"
        "Hello World": "Tim"    // Multiword properties need to have ""
    }

    Note:
    - the key in Objects are string ... if the property name is multiword with a space, we need to use double Quotes

    Note:
    - Objects declared with "const"  can be modified
    Ex:
    const user = {
        name: "John"
    }

    user.name = "Tim"
    console.log(user.name) // Returns Tim

    Why does it not through an error ?
    - const only throws an error if we try to set user to something else (ex. user = ...)

    <h2>Square Brackets</h2>
    - Used for multiword properties
    - Rule of thumb: If the properties contain a space, then use the square brackets to access the properties
    Ex: 
    let user = {}
    user[Hello World] = true


    <h2>Computed Properties</h2>
    - We can use square brackets <b>"[]"</b>in object literal
    
    Ex:
    let fruit = prompt("Which fruid do you want to buy", apple)
    let bag = {
        [fruit]:5,
    }

    alert(bag.apple)


    <h2>Property Value Shorthand</h2>
    Ex:
    function makeUser(name, age) {
        return {
            name: name,
            age: age,
        }
    }

    let user = makeUser("Tim", "33")
    alert(user.name)

    Note:
    - We can use normal properties and shorthand in the same Object
    Ex:
    let user = {
        name,       // same as name:name
        age:30
    }

    <h2>Property existence test ... "in" operator</h2>
    - In JS, its possible to access any property.
     > If property does NOT exist, there will be no error =(
     > Reading an undefined property just returns undefined

     Ex:
     let user = {}
     console.log(user.noSuchProperty == undefined) // returns true

    - We can also check if a property exists by using the "in" keyword

    Ex:
    let user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    }

    console.log("age" in user)  // returns true
    console.llog("helloworld" in user) // returns false

    <h2>Object Properties Order</h2>
    - Are object properties ordered ? 
    > Somewhat. Integer properties are ordered, other appear in order of creation

    Ex:
    let user = {
        name: "Tim",
        surname: "Rom",
    }
    user.age = 33

    for (let prop in user) {
        console.log("Property: " + prop);
    }
