    <h1>Objects</h1>
    
    What ? 
    - Used to store collections of data 

    How to create an Object in JS ?
    Ex:
    let user = Object();
    let user = {};      // this is called an Object literal

    let user = {
        name:"John",        // These are properties
        age:"33"
    }


    Note:
    - Objects declared with "const"  can be modified
    Ex:
    const user = {
        name: "John"
    }

    user.name = "Tim"
    console.log(user.name) // Returns Tim

    Why does it not through an error ?
    - const only throws an error if we try to set user to something else (ex. user = ...)

    <h2>Square Brackets</h2>
    - Used for multiword properties
    - Rule of thumb: If the properties contain a space, then use the square brackets to access the properties
    Ex:
    let user = {}
    user[Hello World] = true


    <h2>Computer Properties</h2>
    - We can use square brackets in object literal
    
    Ex:
    let fruit = prompt("Which fruid do you want to buy", apple)
    let bag = {
        [fruit]:5,
    }

    alert(bag.apple)


    <h2>Property Value Shorthand</h2>
    Ex:
    function makeUser(name, age) {
        return {
            name: name,
            age: age,
        }
    }

    let user = makeUser("Tim", "33")
    alert(user.name)

    Note:
    - We can use normal properties and shorthand in the same Object
    Ex:
    let user = {
        name,       // same as name:name
        age:30
    }
