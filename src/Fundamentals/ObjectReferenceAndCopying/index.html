    <h1>Object References and Copying</h1>

    <h2>Comparison by Reference</h2>
    - Two objects are equal ONLY if they are the same object
    Ex:
    let a = {}
    let b = a
    console.log(a==b) // true
    console.log(a===b) // true 

    Why ? 
    - Because a and b both refer to the same object

    <h2>Cloning and Merging</h2>
    - How to clone an object ? 
    Ex: 
    let user = {
        name: "Tim",
        age: 33,
    }
    let clone = {}
    
    # Clone here
    for (let key in user) {
        clone[key] = user[key];
    }

    <h2>Object Assign</h2>
    - We can also clone object using Object.assign

    Syntax:
    Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, ...])
    - dest is the target object
    - src1, src2 are source objects which will copy all properties of src1,2 ...etc ONTO dest

    Ex:
    let user = {
        name: "Tim",
        age: 33
    }

    let src1 = {
        Address: "1 York St."
    }

    let src2 = {
        occupation: "Me"
    }

    Object.assign(user, src1, src2)     // Places all properties onto user
    let clone = Object.assign({}, src1, src2)   // Creates new object and puts properties of src1 and src2 into new object

    <h2>Nested Cloninng & DEEP Cloning</h2>
    - TBD
