        <h1>Comparisons</h1>
        - Boolean is the result 


        <h2>String comparisons</h2>
        - Comparison is done lexiographically ... ie: Strings are compared letter by letter

        <h2>Comparisons of Different Types</h2>
        - When comparing values of different types, JS converts values to numbers
        Ex:
        alert('2' > 1) // true, string '2' becomes a number 2
        alert('01' == 1) // true, string '01' becomes a number 1

        <h2>Strict Equality "==="</h2>
        - Regular equality check "==" cannot differentiate between 0 from false
        Ex: alert(0 == false) // true
        alert('' == false) // true

        Why ? Because operands of different types are converted to NUMBERS by the equality operator ==

        How to resolve issue ?
        - Use a Strict Equality operator "==="
        
        <b>Strict Equality operator === will check the equality WITHOUT type conversion</b>
        - Hence if a and b are of differenty types, a === b will automatically return false

        <h2>Comparisons with null & undefined</h2>
        - Undefined and null are weird  ...why ?
        null === undefined    // Will return false
        null == udefined       // Will return true

        - When using maths to compare undefined or null:
        > null becomes 0  
        > undefined becomes NaN

        Note:
        null == 0 // false
        null > 0 // false
        null >= 0 // true

        Why ? 
        - Because equality check == and comparison  >, >= ...etc work differently
        - Comparions convert null to a number, treating it as 0
        - Equality check == for undefined and null  equals each other and dont equal anything else ... Hence null == 0 // false

        - Also undefined should NOT be compared to other values

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        - Treat any comparison with undefined / null  with strict equality comparator === 
        - Do Not use comparisons >, >= ...etc with any variable which maybe null or undefined. Chek for them seperately

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        - Comparison operators return a boolean value.
        - Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.
        - The values null and undefined equal == each other and do not equal any other value.
        - Be careful when using comparisons like > or < with variables that can occasionally be null/undefined. Checking for null/undefined separately is a good idea.
