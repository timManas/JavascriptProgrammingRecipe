    <h1>Symbols</h1>
    - Represent a Unique Identifier
    - Can be created using 'Symbol()'

    Ex: let id = Symbol()
    let id2 = Symbol("id")      // the 'id' is the symbol name used for debugging purposes

    - <b>Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create symbols with the same name, they are differnt values</b>
    - Symbols do NOT convert to String
    Ex:
    let id1 = Symbol("id")
    let id2 = Symbol("id")
    console.log(id1 === id2)        // Returns false

    - We can access the Symbol name descripton by using: user.description
    ex:
    let id = Symbol("id")
    alert(id.description)

    <h2>Hidden Properties</h2>
    - Symbols allow creation of "Hidden" properties that no other code can accidentally access or overwrite

    ex:
    let user = {
        name:"Tim"
    }
    let id = Symbol("id")
    user[id] = 1
    console.log(user[id])   // We can access the data using Symbol as the key

    Why use Symbol("id") vs "id" ?
    - User may belong to another code, hence we should NOT add fields to it. (Very unsafe)
    - Since symbols cannot be accessed accidentaly, hence the third-party code will not be able to see it


    <h2>Symbols in Object Literals</h2>
    - In order to use symbols in object literals, we need to place square brackets around it

    Ex:
    let id = Symbol("id")
    let user = {
        name:"Tim",
        [id]: 123
    }

    <h2>Symbols are skipped by for ... in </h2>
    - Symbolic properties do not get read in for ... in loop
    Ex:
    let id = Symbol("id")
    let user = {
        name: "Tim",
        age:33,
        [id]:123
    }

    for (let key in user)
        alert(key)          // Does NOT return the Symbol [id]

    <h2>Global Symbols</h2>
    - Sometimes we need to access the exact same symbols
    - Different part of the app needs to access symbol "id" meaning exactly the same property

    How ?
    - We need to use the Global system regisrty
    - Create symbols in it and access them later.
    - This guarantees that repeated access by the same name return exactly the same symbol

    Ex:
    let id = Symbol.for("id")       // Read from the global registy. If no exist, creates it
    let id2 = Symbol.for("id")       

    alert(id === id2)       // returns true

    - Symbols inside the registry are called "Global Symbols". Accessible everywhere in the code
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    - Symbols is a primitive type of unique Identifier
    - Created with Symbol() with an optional description (name)
    - Symbols are always different values, even if they have the same name
        > We want same-named symbols to be equal, we need to use GLOBAL Registry: Symbol.for(key)
        > Multiple calls of Symbol.for(key) with the same key returns the same Symbol
    - Main uses of Symbols is to hide object properties
    - Do not appear in for..in loops. To avoid accidental override
