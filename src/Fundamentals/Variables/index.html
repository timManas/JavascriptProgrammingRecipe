    <p>
        Variables:
        <br>- Can hold a string value at one moment then int in another
        <br>Why ? JS is dynamically typed
    </p>
    

    <p>
        Number:
        <br>Number can represent an int or float point number
    </p>

    <p>
        BigInt:
        <br> the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
        <br> Ex: const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    </p>

    <p> 
        String
        <br> 3 Types of Quotes
        <br> Double quotes: "Hello".
        <br> Single quotes: 'Hello'.
        <br> Backticks: `Hello`.

        <br> Note: Backticks are extended functionality quotes. Allow us to embed variables and expressions 
        <br> into String by wrapping them in ${}

        <br> There is NO char type in Javascript
    </p>

    <p>
        Boolean
        <br> Either true or false
    </p> 

    <p> 
        Null value
        <br> Special value which represents Nothing
        <br> Ex: let age = null
    </p>


    <p>
        Undefined value
        <br> Means "Value is not Assigned"
        <br> Ex: let age .... alert(age)
        <br> Undefined is reserved as default initial value for unassigned things
    </p>

    <p>
        Objects and Symbols
        <br>Symbols is used to create unique identifiers for objects
    </p>

    <p>
        Tip:
        <br> Use the typeof(x) operator to find out what type a variable is
    </p>
